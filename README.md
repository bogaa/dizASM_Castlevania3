Dissasembly WIP

- Here I ported CV3 to a format so I can dissaemble it with Diztinguish.
- It is possible to build the NES file with mostly ASAR and a batch script.
- When you assemble the export with Asar you get the file needed to view the dissasembly with Diz. https://github.com/IsoFrieze/DiztinGUIsh
- The output is ment for research.
